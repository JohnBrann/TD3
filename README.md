This is an implementation of the TD3 algorithm that uses simulation environments from Gymnasium by OpenAi.

This is one of the training runs on the Bipedal Walker simulation environement. We were able top acheive successful results after 1200 episodes.

This was also tested on one of the Classic Control environments called Pendulum. We received successful results after roughly 400 episodes.
